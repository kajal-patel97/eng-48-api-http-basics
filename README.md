- What is conceptually an API
     - a way for computers to talk to each other 
     - web API's are formatted and consumed by JSON 

- How API's and HTTP(rotocol) (protocol) and requests work 
- HTTP request and JSON 
- Examples of API services & growth via API 
- API in finance, work, telecommunications, data, (...)

HTTP: has two requests 
- GET - sending information usually in the form of a URL (a path + argument) or header (what country you are in, what device u are using which goes into a URL ). HTML recieved.

- POST - it has a url with arguments, it also sends a big JSON file (a dictionary) this is very easy to use , could also send XML (used on old computers). JSON is received back 

## Response Codes 
 - 200 - successful page 
 - 300 - more than one response 
 - 400 - page not found/ wrong path (error in front end)
